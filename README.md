# Remote Weather Station using LPC1768
This is a code for a Weather Station using an ARM Cortex M3 board, specifically the LPC1768

The interface.c file is just a placeholder for the file with the main function. 
Will be replaced later.

The files in the DHT folder are the original interfacing files in C++.
I have managed to partially translate the code, full translation is planned.
